# Humane Lobby Day (HLD)
This app is designed to ease the check-in process for Humane Lobby Day, a day of grassroots lobbying of state legislators, organized by the Humane Society of the United States.  

At the top of the main page, there is a tally of number of people who have checked in, who have not yet checked in, and who have cancelled. Hovering over these numbers will bring up a tooltip that displays the names of the people in each category.

When a person is ready to check in, an HSUS volunteer can quickly and easily search the list of registered names to find the person. Clicking on the person's name will bring up a details page, where the volunteer can change the person's check in status to Yes, No, or Cancelled.  The details page also displays the person's Representative and Senator, as well as the names of other people who have the same legislators and whether those people have checked in yet.

There is also a coverage page that shows the Representatives and Senators who had at least one constituent register but who do not have anyone checked in yet.  This allows for a quick way to identify which meetings need to be cancelled due to No-Shows.
